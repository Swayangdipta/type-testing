    `Shiva gazed at the orange sky. The clouds hovering above Mansarovar had just parted to
    reveal the setting sun. The brilliant giver of life was calling it a day once again. Shiva had seen a
    few sunrises in his twenty-one years. But the sunset! He tried never to miss the sunset! On any
    other day, Shiva would have taken in the vista — the sun and the immense lake against the
    magnificent backdrop of the Himalayas stretching as far back as the eye could see. But not
    today.
    He squatted and perched his lithe, muscular body on the narrow ledge extending over the
    lake. The numerous batde-scars on his skin gleamed in the shimmering reflected light of the
    waters. Shiva remembered well his carefree childhood days. He had perfected the art of
    throwing pebbles that bounced off the surface of the lake. He still held the record in his tribe for
    the highest number of bounces: seventeen.
    On a normal day, Shiva would have smiled at the memory from a cheerful past that had
    been overwhelmed by the angst of the present. But today, he turned back towards his village
    without any hint of joy.
    Bhadra was alert, guarding the main entrance. Shiva gestured with his eyes. Bhadra turned
    back to find his two back-up soldiers dozing against the fence. He cursed and kicked them
    hard.
    Shiva turned back towards the lake.
    God bless Bhadra! At least he takes some responsibility.
    Shiva brought the chillum made of yak-bone to his hps and took in a deep drag. Any other
    day, the marijuana would have spread its munificence, dulling his troubled mind and letting him
    find some moments of solace. But not today.
    He looked left, at the edge of the lake where the soldiers of the strange foreign visitor were
    kept under guard. With the lake behind them and twenty of Shiva’s own soldiers guarding them,
    it was impossible for them to mount any surprise attack.
    They let themselves be disarmed so easily. They aren’t like the bloodthirsty idiots in our land
    who are looking for any excuse to fight.
    The foreigner’s words came flooding back to Shiva. ‘Come to our land. It lies beyond the
    great mountains. Others call it Meluha. I call it Heaven. It is the richest and most powerful
    empire in India. Indeed the richest and most powerful in the whole world. Our government has
    an offer for immigrants. You will be given fertile land and resources for farming. Today, your
    tribe, the Gunas, fight for survival in this rough, arid land. Meluha offers you a lifestyle beyond
    your wildest dreams. We ask for nothing in return. Just live in peace, pay your taxes and follow
    the laws of the land.’
    Shiva mused that he would certainly not be a chief in this new land.
    Would I really miss that so much?
    His tribe would have to live by the laws of the foreigners. They would have to work every
    day for a living.
    That’s better than fighting every day just to stay alive!
    Shiva took another puff from his chillum. As the smoke cleared, he turned to stare at the hut
    in the centre of his village, right next to his own, where the foreigner had been stationed. He
    had been told that he could sleep there in comfort. In fact, Shiva wanted to keep him hostage.
    Just in case.
    We fight almost every month with the Pakratis just so that our village can exist next to the
    holy lake. They are getting stronger every year, forming new alliances with new tribes. We can
    beat the Pakratis, but not all the mountain tribes together! By moving to Meluha, we can
    escape this pointless violence and may be live a life of comfort. What could possibly be wrong
    with that? Why shouldn’t we take this deal? It sounds so damn good!
    Shiva took one last drag from the chillum before banging it on the rock, letting the ash slip
    out and rose quickly from his perch. Brushing a few specks of ash from his bare chest, he
    wiped his hands on his tiger skin skirt, rapidly striding to his village. Bhadra and his back-up
    stood to attention as Shiva passed the gate. Shiva frowned and gestured for Bhadra to ease
    up.
    Why does he keep forgetting that he has been my closestfriend since childhood? My
    becoming the chief hasn’t really changed anything. He doesn’t need to behave unnecessarily
    servile in front of others.
    The huts in Shiva’s village were luxurious compared to others in their land. A grown man
    could actually stand upright in them. The shelter could withstand the harsh mountain winds for
    nearly three years before surrendering to the elements. He flung the empty chillum into his hut
    as he strode to the hut where the visitor lay sleeping soundly.`,
    `Shiva and Nandi were walking back to the royal guest house. Shiva had decided he
    wanted to eat lunch alone. Nandi walked a few steps behind, his head bowed in selfrecrimination. ‘My Lord, I am so sorry’
    Shiva turned around to gaze at Nandi.
    ‘You are right, my Lord. We were so lost in our own troubles and the search for the
    Neelkanth that we didn’t realise the unfairness of our actions on immigrants. I misled you my
    Lord. I lied to you.’
    Shiva didn’t say anything. He continued to stare intensely into Nandi’s eyes.
    ‘I am so sorry my Lord. I have failed you. I will accept whatever punishment you give me.’
    Shiva’s lips broke into a very faint smile. He patted Nandi lightly on his shoulders, signalling
    he had forgiven him. But his eyes delivered a clear message. ‘Never lie to me again, my friend.’
    Nandi nodded and whispered, ‘Never, my Lord. I am so sorry’
    ‘Forget it Nandi,’ said Shiva, his smile a little broader now. ‘It’s in the past.’
    They turned and continued walking. Suddenly Shiva shook his head and chuckled slighdy.
    ‘Strange people!’
    ‘What is it, my Lord?’ asked Nandi.
    ‘Nothing really. I was just wondering at some of the interesting things about your society.’
    ‘Interesting, my Lord?’ asked Nandi, feeling a little more confident now that Shiva was
    speaking to him again.
    ‘Well, some people in your country think just the presence of my blue throat can help you
    achieve impossible tasks. Some people actually think that my name has suddenly become so
    holy that they can’t even speak it.’
    Nandi smiled slightly.
    ‘On the other hand,’ continued Shiva, ‘some people clearly think that I am not required. In
    fact, they even think that my touching them is so polluting that I need to get a shudhikaran
    done!’
    ‘Shudhikaran? Why would you need that my Lord?’ asked Nandi, a little concerned.
    Shiva weighed his words carefully. ‘Well, I touched someone. And I was told that I would
    need to undergo a shudhikaran.’
    ‘What? Who did you touch my Lord? Was it a vikarma person?’ asked a troubled Nandi.
    ‘Only the touch of a vikarma person would mean that you would need to get a shudhikaran.’
    Shiva’s face abruptly changed colour. A veil lifted from his eyes. He suddenly understood the
    significance of the events of the previous day. Her hasty withdrawal at being touched. The
    shocked reactions from the Guruji and Krittika.
    ‘Go back to the guest house, Nandi. I will see you there,’ said Shiva, as he turned towards
    the guest house garden.
    ‘My Lord, what happened?’ asked Nandi, trying to keep pace with Shiva. ‘Did you get the
    shudhikaran done or not?’
    ‘Go to the guest house Nandi,’ said Shiva walking rapidly away. ‘I will see you there.’
    Shiva waited for the larger part of an hour. But it was in vain, for Sati did not make an
    appearance. He sat on the bench by himself, cursing the moment when that terrible thought had
    entered his mind.
    How could I have even thought that Sati would find my touch polluting? I am such a bloody
    idiot!
    He replayed moments of that fateful encounter in his mind and analysed every facet of it.
    ‘If something happened to you, I would never be able to forgive myself.’
    What did she mean by saying that? Does she have feelings for me? Or is she just an
    honourable woman who can’t bear to be the cause of someone else’s misfortune? And why
    should she think of herself as inferior? This entire concept of the vikarma is so damned
    ridiculous!
    Realising that she wasn’t going to come, Shiva got up. He kicked the bench hard, getting a
    painful reminder that his once numb toe had got its sensation back. Cursing out loud, he started
    walking back to the guest house. Walking past the stage, he noticed that there was something
    lying on the dance floor. He went closer and bent down to pick it up. It was her bead bracelet.
    He had seen it on her right hand. The string did not seem broken.
    Had she purposely dropped it here?
    He smelt it. It had the fragrance of the holy lake on a sun-kissed evening. He brought it
    delicately to his lips and kissed it gently. Smiling, he dropped the bracelet into the pouch tied
    around his waist. He would come back from Mount Mandar and meet her. He had to meet her.
    He would pursue her to the end of the world if required. He would fight the entire human race to
    have her. His journey in this life was incomplete without her. His heart knew it. His soul knew it.`,
    `It was approaching midnight on an early May night in 2004. J.N. Dixit and I were in the studios of the
    BBC on the top floor of the AIFACS building on Rafi Marg in New Delhi, discussing how the result
    of the General Elections, now in its final stages, would impact Indian foreign and economic policy.
    The election campaign had come alive in its last stages, after having begun with the widespread
    assumption that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, led by Prime Minister Atal
    Bihari Vajpayee, would be returned to office. Vajpayee had advanced the election dates by six months
    in the hope of riding a wave of optimism about India’s economic prospects captured by the ‘India
    Shining’ campaign mounted by his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the leading party in the alliance.
    However, reports of suicides by cotton farmers in Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra had tarnished the
    NDA’s image and it now appeared that its battle with the principal Opposition party, the Indian
    National Congress, would be closely fought.
    Dixit, known by the nickname Mani, was a former foreign secretary, and an outstanding one at that.
    After his retirement, he had joined the Congress party and guided party president Sonia Gandhi
    through the foreign policy debates of the early years of the new millennium. Until Mani Dixit joined
    her, Sonia Gandhi’s principal adviser on foreign policy had been K. Natwar Singh, a diplomat who
    had worked closely with Indira Gandhi and then joined the Congress party. Natwar was a
    quintessential Nehruvian and his thinking was shaped by the Cold War and India’s policy of nonalignment. Mani Dixit’s views, on the other hand, were shaped by the end of the Cold War and India’s
    increased engagement with developed economies. As foreign secretary during the Congress
    government headed by Narasimha Rao in the early 1990s, he had crafted India’s response to the end
    of the Cold War and the collapse of its ally, the Soviet Union, authoring radical departures such as
    Rao’s ‘Look East Policy’ and his openings to South Korea and Israel.
    In 2003 Mani Dixit had been authorized by Sonia Gandhi to draft an alternative view on foreign and
    national security policy and had put together a discussion group that included, among others,
    Manmohan Singh, then leader of the Congress party in the Rajya Sabha, the Upper House of
    Parliament, N.N.Vohra, a retired defence secretary, K. Subrahmanyam, who was until his death in 2011
    India’s leading thinker on strategic affairs, and myself. I was then chief editor of the Financial
    Express (FE). We would meet in the private dining room of the India International Centre, the club
    favoured by Delhi’s policy elite.
    Since Mani had been given this new political task, I assumed he would play an important role if the
    Congress came to power in Delhi. I was therefore surprised to hear him ask the anchor at the BBC
    studio that night to wind up the discussion since he had to leave Delhi in the morning to spend the
    summer in the hills. The elections would soon be over and some expected the Congress party to form
    a government. Would you not prefer to remain in Delhi and see if they need you in the new
    government, I asked Mani curiously.
    He laughed the question off. He pointed out that even if the Congress did come to power, Natwar
    Singh would be in the government, not him, and went on to ask, ‘You think we will win?’ I echoed the
    popular view around Delhi that the result would be narrow but Prime Minister Vajpayee was likely to
    return to office. He agreed with me.
    As we walked out of the studio I said to him cheerily, ‘You go to the hills, I am off to DC.’
    Neither of us could have imagined on that May night that within a month we would be colleagues in
    the PMO.
    It became clear, just a day later, that Sonia Gandhi had got enough seats to form a new coalition
    government led by the Congress party. Shortly before I flew to Washington DC to speak at a
    conference organized by the historian Sunil Khilnani, I typed out an editorial comment that appeared
    on 15 May with the title ‘Thoughts on a Government’. It was typical of the editorials that editors like
    to write, advising politicians what they should do. My advice to the victorious Congress President
    Sonia Gandhi was simple—’. . . invite Dr Manmohan Singh to take charge as the Prime Minister’ and
    make herself ‘the chairperson of the Congress and allies coordination committee that would oversee
    the functioning of the government’.
    My suggestion that Dr Singh be made PM was not a new idea. I had floated it five years earlier,
    almost to the date, on 25 May 1999, in a column in the Times of India. This was shortly after Sonia
    Gandhi’s failed attempt to form a Congress-led coalition government after the fall of a BJP-led
    government. She had famously and, as it turned out, erroneously announced, ‘We have 272 (MPs),
    and we hope to get more.’ Provocatively titled ‘Perils of Sonia Gandhi as PM’, my column advised
    Sonia to resist the temptation of claiming the job and, instead, name Manmohan Singh as PM, were
    Congress to form a government.
    Reading my 2004 editorial, journalist friends who had scoffed at me in 1999 for coming up with a
    wild idea were amused that I had not given up my ‘campaign’, as some saw it, to make Manmohan
    Singh prime minister. I was, however, looking at the issue from Sonia’s point of view. She needed to
    bury the controversy over her Italian birth and retain control of the Congress party till her son or
    daughter was old enough to take charge. She required, therefore, a reliable, trustworthy and capable
    head of government. A political leader would always nurse political ambitions and perhaps seek to
    marginalize the Gandhi family. Hadn’t Narasimha Rao, low profile though he was before he became
    PM, tried to strike out on his own once he assumed office? By this argument, senior Congress leaders
    and possible prime ministerial aspirants like Arjun Singh and Pranab Mukherjee were pretty much
    ruled out. Among the safer choices, few had the experience for the job. A.K. Antony, a Congress
    leader from Kerala whom Sonia Gandhi reportedly liked, did not, for example. So, I surmised, Dr
    Singh stood the best chance.
    On the day I arrived in DC, 15 May, news reports suggested that Sonia Gandhi was in two minds on
    whether or not to head the government that was now likely to be formed. Sycophantic as ever, the
    rank and file of the party demanded that she become prime minister. On the other hand, BJP leader
    Sushma Swaraj, who had campaigned vociferously against an Italian-origin prime minister, was
    dramatically threatening to shave her head if Sonia did so.
    Over the next two days, the subject of government formation in India dominated coffee- and lunchbreak conversations at the conference I was attending. On 18 May, the last day of the conference, I
    shared the dais with Khilnani and Montek Singh Ahluwalia, an economist who had worked with Rajiv
    Gandhi and had been secretary in the finance ministry when Dr Singh was finance minister, and was
    now with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington DC.
    Montek spoke first. Shortly after he began speaking, I received an SMS message on my mobile
    phone from my colleague Rohit Bansal, resident editor of the Delhi edition of the Financial Express.
    It announced, ‘Sonia says she will not be PM!’ I thought to myself: Step one, she will not be PM. Step
    two, she will make Dr Singh the PM.
    When my turn came, I gave my audience the breaking news. I then said mischievously that if Sonia
    named Manmohan Singh as PM, they may have just heard the future principal secretary to the Indian
    prime minister speak. I was referring, of course, to Montek. Not surprisingly, Montek was mobbed as
    soon as the session got over. Later that day, Sonia announced that Dr Singh would head a coalition
    government. The next day, I met Montek and his economist wife, Isher, for lunch at the IMF
    headquarters. They were excited about the news from Delhi. All we talked about over lunch was what
    a Manmohan Singh prime ministership would mean for the country.
    While Isher had been Dr Singh’s student at the Delhi School of Economics, Montek’s association
    with Dr Singh dated back to the late 1970s when he returned to India after a stint at the World Bank to
    join the ministry of finance as an economic adviser. Dr Singh was at the time a secretary in the
    ministry of finance and had encouraged Montek to join the government. The two worked together
    again in 1992-96 when Dr Singh, by then finance minister in the Rao government, re-inducted Montek
    into the ministry. None of us spoke about what role Montek expected to play—it was too early to
    engage in that kind of speculation. I did ask, though, if he had spoken to Dr Singh and he said he had
    called and wished him.
    As we ordered dessert, I asked Montek if he would quit his IMF job and move to India. ‘Of course!’
    Isher replied for him, instantly.`,
    `I went to meet Dr Singh on Monday at the prime minister’s sprawling official residence, 7 Race
    Course Road—7 RCR as it is popularly called—at the edge of Lutyens’ Delhi and bordering
    diplomatic enclave. After Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination, the security around the PM’s official
    residence has become so elaborate that entering it is quite an ordeal. The Special Protection Group
    (SPG), an elite security unit protecting the PM, which was created in 1985 after Indira Gandhi’s
    assassination, allows in only such visitors whose names have been provided to them by the personal
    secretary to the PM. After driving through the first gate of the outer compound, visitors alight near
    the second gate. Only ministers, authorized officials and foreign dignitaries are allowed to drive
    through the second gate, and get into SPG vehicles that will take them a couple of hundred yards
    down the road to the PMO. Those less privileged must first walk into a visitors’ room, deposit their
    mobile phones and be screened by security. Only then are they ferried by the SPG in its fleet of Maruti
    cars to the Prime Minister’s Office.
    Having done the ride, I was ushered straight in to meet Dr Singh. He was in the chair on the right
    side of the room on which PMs usually sit when they meet visitors, and welcomed me with a smile. I
    walked up and sat on a chair placed to his left.
    ‘I was not prepared for this role,’ he confessed. ‘This is a new experience and it will not be easy.
    We are a minority government. The Left has only agreed to support us from the outside. The
    Congress party has never run a coalition government. I will have to make a success of it. I need a
    press secretary. I know you, so I would be happy if you agreed to work here. I know it will mean a
    financial loss for you, but you will have to view this as an opportunity to serve the nation.’
    I told him Vohra had already briefed me about his impending offer and, without further ado,
    accepted his invitation to work for him. Our conversation turned to matters of rank and nomenclature.
    I pointed out that two persons had handled the media in the PMO of the previous prime minister, Atal
    Bihari Vajpayee, and both were called ‘officer on special duty’—OSD in bureaucratic parlance.
    However, when other editors had taken up the same assignment in the past, they had been called
    information advisers to the PM. I would prefer to be called media adviser, I said, explaining that with
    the advent of news television the word ‘media’ had replaced ‘press’, and ‘information’ sounded
    archaic. He agreed.
    Finally I asked him what he expected of me. He reflected for a moment, then said, ‘Sitting here, I
    know I will be isolated from the outside world. I want you to be my eyes and ears. Tell me what you
    think I should know, without fear or favour.’
    Those words remained embedded in my mind and every time I hesitated to convey an inconvenient
    truth or an embarrassing tale over those four years with him, I would recall them and feel
    emboldened. Even after leaving the PMO, I used the privilege bestowed on me by those words to tell
    him, impartially, what I felt he ought to know.
    I told Dr Singh that Sharada Prasad, Indira Gandhi’s widely respected information adviser, was a
    family friend and that I would meet him and seek his guidance. He agreed. ‘Yes, Sharada is a good
    man. You should keep in touch with him and take his advice.’
    Anxious to get his team in place quickly, he insisted I join immediately since the new Parliament
    was scheduled to convene that week. I agreed to begin work two days later.
    Strangely, on a day when my life took a new turn, Rama was in distant Canada and Tanvika in
    Hyderabad. I had no one at home to go to. So I first called my parents to give them the news, and then
    Shekhar Gupta, CEO of the Express group, to which the Financial Express belonged. Shekhar was
    attending a conference in Istanbul and was understandably dismayed at the prospect of my immediate
    exit. Yet he graciously said he would keep my chair at FE vacant since it was unlikely this new
    coalition experiment with the Left would work.
    ‘It is a thankless job, boss!’ he warned me. ‘This government will not last its term. You will be
    unemployed in a year’s time.’
    Shekhar stuck to his promise of keeping the editor’s chair warm for me for nearly six months,
    before deciding that the Manmohan Singh government would last longer than many had imagined and
    that he needed a full-time editor to run the paper.
    By Monday evening, the orders were issued and the news was splashed across TV screens. My life
    changed instantly and my mobile phone never ceased to ring.
    A day after joining the PMO, I called on H.Y. Sharada Prasad to seek his blessings and advice. A
    compact, personable man, Sharada Prasad exuded sagacity. His tiny apartment was filled with books
    and memorabilia from his years in public life. Rare photographs of Gandhiji and Nehru adorned the
    walls. He spoke softly, choosing his words with deliberation and care.
    ‘So what room have they given you?’ he asked keenly, as any veteran of the PMO would, knowing
    how much perceptions about an official’s proximity to the PM, and hence his power and influence,
    were shaped by what room he had been given.
    I said I would be sitting in the very room that he had sat in, when I met him for the first time in
    1981. However, since that room was being refurbished, I would temporarily occupy the corner room
    next to the Cabinet room, near the prime minister’s office on the first floor.
    ‘Ah!’ he exclaimed. ‘That is a historic room. The first office room of the first prime minister of
    free India!’
    Jawaharlal Nehru spent his first few days in office sitting in that small room adjacent to the Cabinet
    room because the room that he was to occupy as PM was being used by Sir Girija Shankar Bajpai,
    secretary general of the ministry of external affairs (MEA). It took a few days for Bajpai to move to a
    new room and for the room to be refurbished for India’s first prime minister.
    ‘In my time I met the editors of the major dailies regularly,’ Sharada Prasad said to me. ‘But in
    those days there were only five editors who mattered. The editors of the Statesman, the Times of India,
    The Hindu, the Indian Express and Hindustan Times. These days you have too many newspapers, and
    television too. But try and keep in touch with those who matter. Make sure the PM meets them
    informally once in a while. Make sure the PM compliments an editor and a columnist whenever
    something worth complimenting is written. Reach out to the Indian- language media. Every morning
    give the PM a list of major headlines. Make sure you have some role in speech-writing. The civil
    servants will not like it. But as an editor you have writing skills that the PM would benefit from. Use
    them.’
    I asked him if the PM should address a press conference.
    ‘Of course, but not right now,’ he said. ‘In the next month, let him meet editors and publishers in
    small groups. These should be off-the-record conversations. They should get to know him, he should
    get to know them. After a couple of months, organize a press conference. Make sure you conduct it.
    And make sure you have thought of the headlines you want the next day. Never organize a media
    interaction without deciding what headline you want to come out of it!’
    In the following weeks, I faithfully followed each of these instructions. I arranged a series of
    breakfast meetings with important editors, publishers and TV anchors. As an early riser, Dr Singh
    would schedule his breakfast meetings for half past eight. Being late to bed and late to rise, editors
    and TV anchors would protest, but turn up on time. When I invited a group of publishers, the only
    ones to arrive late were Shobhana Bhartia of Hindustan Times because, as she told me, she took a
    long time drying her hair, and Indu Jain, chairperson of the Times of India, because she had to finish
    her morning puja.
    Whenever the PM visited a state capital, I would arrange an interaction with the local media. This
    became an important institution of communication for the PM. It helped break the monopoly of the
    largely English-language Delhi media over access to him. Editors and correspondents from the
    Indian-language media got an opportunity to interact with Dr Singh and make their own assessment of
    a man few of them had ever known. Between 2004 and 2008, Dr Singh addressed a press conference,
    open to all media, in every single state capital he visited, including Port Blair, the capital of the
    Andaman and Nicobar Islands. This investment of time in befriending regional media, including the
    Urdu-language media, proved invaluable during the national debate on the India-US civil nuclear
    agreement, and whenever the PM came under attack from Delhi’s media. I did incur the wrath of New
    Delhi’s prima donnas every now and then for adopting this inclusive policy, especially if I opted to
    give the editor of a regional media group exclusive time with Dr Singh on board the PM’s aircraft on
    one of his foreign trips, ignoring the requests of a New Delhi editor.
    As I entered into my new role, my last courtesy call was to the home of P.V Narasimha Rao. During
    his tenure as PM, there were only two Hyderabadi editors in Delhi, A.M. Khusro at the Financial
    Express and myself, and he knew us both. I had kept in touch with Rao even after he had retired from
    active politics. On this latest visit, I found him all alone and reading a book, when his long-serving
    assistant, Khandekar, ushered me in. Over tea and biscuits, I gave Rao an account of the call from the
    PMO and my meeting with Dr Singh, and the words of advice from Sharada Prasad.
    Rao found it significant that Dr Singh had not opted for a political journalist or a government
    official as his media adviser but had chosen an economic journalist like myself. ‘Of course, he knows
    Vithal,’ he added, referring to my father, and suggested Dr Singh’s choice may have also been shaped
    by that fact.
    ‘Good,’ he said, as he sipped his tea. ‘Manmohan needs your help.’
    Dr Singh’s three key aides in the PMO happened to be, by mere happenstance, Malayalees and all
    Nairs to boot: J.N. ‘Mani’ Dixit, the new national security adviser (NSA), T.K.A. Nair, the prime
    minister’s principal secretary, and M.K. Narayanan, the special adviser for internal security.
    The power and importance of the principal secretary to the PM has always been dependent on the
    latter’s political clout, apart from the officer’s own standing within the civil service. As the
    bureaucratic link between the PM and senior ministers and secretaries to government, the principal
    secretary commands authority and influences policy. Most principal secretaries have been extremely
    capable men, well regarded by their peers and respected by their subordinates, like P.N. Haksar in
    Indira Gandhi’s PMO, P.C. Alexander in Rajiv’s, A.N. Varma in Narasimha Rao’s, Satish Chandran in
    Gowda’s, N.N. Vohra in Gujral’s and Brajesh Mishra in Vajpayee’s. However, every now and then, a
    nondescript official of limited talent has also adorned that job.
    The national security adviser is an institution created during Vajpayee’s first term, after India
    declared herself a nuclear weapons power and a National Security Council (NSC) was established.
    The NSA is the executive head of the council and, within the PMO, typically deals with the ministries
    of defence and external affairs, the service chiefs and intelligence agencies and the Department of
    Atomic Energy (DAE). Since Manmohan Singh’s PMO also included a special adviser, a novelty
    created to accommodate Narayanan, part of the NSA’s turf, namely the area of internal security, was
    hived off to him.
    Mani Dixit was, without doubt, the dominant personality among the three. His stature ensured that
    T.K.A. Nair was not quite the ‘principal’ secretary that many of his predecessors had been. Of course,
    Nair’s immediate predecessor, the larger-than-life Brajesh Mishra, was more than just a principal
    secretary. I once jokingly remarked to Dr Singh that in Vajpayee’s time the principal secretary
    functioned as if he were the PM, while in his case, it was being said that the PM functioned like a
    principal secretary. This was a comment on Dr Singh’s attention to detail, his involvement in the nittygritty of administration, his chairing of long and tedious meetings with officials, which Vajpayee
    rarely did. He ignored the remark, knowing well that it was also a taunt, drawing attention to the fact
    that Sonia was the political boss.
    Nair was not Dr Singh’s first choice for the all-important post of principal secretary. He had hoped
    to induct N.N. Vohra, who had given me the news of my job. Not only was he a fellow refugee from
    west Punjab, now Pakistan, but both had taught in Punjab University and Vohra also went to Oxford,
    though some years after Dr Singh. Vohra even cancelled a scheduled visit to London to be able to join
    the PMO. Sonia Gandhi had another retired IAS officer, a Tamilian whose name I am not at liberty to
    disclose, in mind for the job. He had worked with Rajiv Gandhi and was regarded as a capable and
    honest official. However, he declined Sonia’s invitation to rejoin government on a matter of principle
    —he had promised his father that he would never seek a government job after retirement.
    With these two distinguished officers ruled out, Dr Singh turned to Nair, a retired IAS officer who
    had worked briefly as secretary to the PM in Gujral’s PMO and had also served as Punjab’s chief
    secretary, the top bureaucrat in the state. Nair’s name was strongly backed by a friend of Dr Singh’s
    family, Rashpal Malhotra, chairman of the Chandigarh-based Centre for Research on Rural and
    Industrial Development (CRRID). Dr Singh himself was the chairman of the CRRID and Nair a
    member of its governing board. Apart from his stint in the Gujral PMO, Nair had neither held the
    rank of secretary in any of the powerful ministries on Raisina Hill—home, finance and defence—nor
    in any key economic ministry. He had only done so in the less powerful ministries of rural
    development and environment and forests. In short, he was a bureaucratic lightweight.
    Always impeccably attired, Nair, small-built and short, lacked the presence of a Brajesh Mishra,
    whose striking demeanour commanded attention. He rarely gave expression to a clear or bold
    opinion on file, always signing off with a ‘please discuss’ and preferring to give oral instructions to
    junior officials such as joint secretaries and deputy secretaries. They would then be required to put
    those instructions on file as their own advice. It was classic bureaucratic risk aversion aimed at never
    getting into any controversy or trouble. Nair depended a great deal on Pulok Chatterjee, a joint
    secretary who had worked with both Rajiv Gandhi and Sonia, for advice on important policy
    decisions.
    Pulok, like Nair, suffered from the handicap that his own service had never regarded him as one of
    its bright sparks. A serving IAS officer, he had never worked in any important ministry. He was
    inducted into Rajiv’s PMO as a deputy secretary after having served as a district official in Amethi,
    his constituency in Uttar Pradesh, where he had caught Rajiv’s eye. After Rajiv’s death, he chose to
    work for the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation where he did some worthwhile social development work. But
    this meant that he was not just outside government but completely identified with the Gandhi family.
    When Pulok returned to government, it was to work on the personal staff of Sonia Gandhi when she
    was leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha.
    Pulok, who was inducted into the Manmohan Singh PMO at the behest of Sonia Gandhi, had
    regular, almost daily, meetings with Sonia at which he was said to brief her on the key policy issues
    of the day and seek her instructions on important files to be cleared by the PM. Indeed, Pulok was the
    single most important point of regular contact between the PM and Sonia. He was also the PMO’s
    main point of contact with the National Advisory Council (NAC), a high-profile advisory body
    chaired by Sonia Gandhi, with social activists as members. It was sometimes dubbed the Shadow
    Cabinet.
    When not at these meetings, the affable, pipe-smoking, and understated Pulok remained mostly
    confined to his room in South Block, rarely travelling outside Delhi. During my time in the PMO, the
    only occasion on which I found him keen on accompanying the PM was when Dr Singh went to Cuba.
    With leftist leanings, Pulok was never too enthusiastic about Dr Singh’s focus on improving relations
    with the US. Whenever Dr Singh and Sonia had to speak from the same platform, Pulok and I would
    exchange their draft speeches so that they remained in step in their public utterances. While I always
    wrote these speeches for the PM, Pulok was largely a messenger carrying Sonia’s speeches to me,
    since her speeches were mostly written by Congress party politicians or her close associates. Pulok
    was in charge of monitoring the implementation of the UPA’s National Common Minimum
    Programme (NCMP)—the joint key objectives of the coalition government. This enabled him to seek
    regular information from all ministries on what they were doing. Pulok would duly produce
    elaborate charts that listed the promises—more than a hundred— enshrined in the NCMP, assign
    responsibility for their implementation to various ministries and report back to the PMO on the status
    of their implementation.
    Apart from teaming up with Pulok, Nair also sought to make himself politically relevant to the PM
    by projecting himself as the PM’s link with the Left. He had been a member of the CPI(M)’s Students
    Federation of India (SFI) during his college days in Kerala. He revived these ties by becoming close
    to the senior CPI(M) leader Harkishan Singh Surjeet, who hailed from Punjab, Nair’s parent state in
    the IAS. Proximity to Surjeet served Nair well, earning him a place in Gujral’s PMO. Apart from
    being fellow Punjabis, Gujral and Surjeet were close friends. During his second stint in the PMO,
    Nair was able to use his association with Surjeet and with CPI(M) leaders from Kerala, especially S.R.
    Pillai, a member of the CPI(M) politburo, to help Dr Singh manage the Left.
    Even with its combined strength, I felt that the Nair-Pulok duo was not a patch on the magisterial
    Brajesh Mishra who ran Vajpayee’s PMO with great aplomb. Even though he was a diplomat by
    training, Mishra, the son of a former Congress chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, had politics in his
    genes and knew exactly what stratagems to adopt to strengthen the authority of the PM in a coalition
    government. His other great qualification, one that both Nair and Pulok lacked, was that he was a risktaker. On critical occasions, Mishra was willing to push the envelope and take things forward on
    behalf of the PM. He established that reputation by taking the decision, along with Vajpayee, to
    conduct nuclear tests in May 1998 and declare India a nuclear weapons state. Mishra’s stature
    consolidated and expanded Vajpayee’s clout within the government. Though he had belonged to the
    Indian Foreign Service (IFS), he was widely respected by the rival IAS. In the Manmohan PMO, on the
    other hand, Nair’s risk-averse personality only compounded Dr Singh’s careful approach and
    contributed to a further dilution of the PM’s authority.
    The third Malayalee, M.K. Narayanan, claimed that he was offered the post of national security
    adviser by Sonia Gandhi, but had instead proposed Mani Dixit’s name for the job because he had to
    tend to his ailing mother, who lived in Chennai. He claimed it was he who drove to Mani’s home in
    Gurgaon to tell him he was being offered the job, and to urge him to take it. Mani, on the other hand,
    believed Sonia may have pushed for Narayanan but Dr Singh wanted him in the job and that
    Narayanan was inducted as a special adviser as a compromise.
    I tended to believe Mani’s version. It was clear to me that Dr Singh shared a bond with him that was
    never there between him and Narayanan. It seemed plausible that the latter had been inducted as the
    third leg of PMO leadership as a concession to Sonia. MK, or Mike, as his contemporaries called
    him, was the intelligence czar who had headed the Intelligence Bureau (IB), India’s internal
    intelligence agency, under both Rajiv Gandhi and Narasimha Rao. He earned his spurs by playing a
    role in the unseating of the first-ever democratically elected communist party government in the
    world, E.M.S. Namboodiripad’s ministry in Kerala, way back in 1957. He was director, IB, when Rajiv
    was assassinated. Narayanan’s favourite line was, ‘I have a file on you.’ He used it, humorously, with
    ministers, officials, journalists and others he met, leaving them, however, with the uneasy feeling that
    he wasn’t really joking. Indeed, Narayanan himself gave currency to the tales that circulated about his
    proclivity to snoop on everyone. He seemed to derive great pleasure in letting me know that he kept a
    tab on the credit-card spending of influential editors. On long flights in the PM’s aircraft, he would
    regale us with stories about how various prime ministers had summoned him for information on
    their colleagues`,
    `Before the beginning there was nothing—no earth, no heavens, no stars, no
    sky: only the mist world, formless and shapeless, and the fire world, always
    burning.
    To the north was Niflheim, the dark world. Here eleven poisonous rivers cut
    through the mist, each springing from the same well at the center of it all, the
    roaring maelstrom called Hvergelmir. Niflheim was colder than cold, and the
    murky mist that cloaked everything hung heavily. The skies were hidden by mist
    and the ground was clouded by the chilly fog.
    To the south was Muspell. Muspell was fire. Everything there glowed and
    burned. Muspell was light where Niflheim was gray, molten lava where the mist
    world was frozen. The land was aflame with the roaring heat of a blacksmith’s
    fire; there was no solid earth, no sky. Nothing but sparks and spurting heat,
    molten rocks and burning embers.
    In Muspell, at the edge of the flame, where the mist burns into light, where
    the land ends, stood Surtr, who existed before the gods. He stands there now. He
    holds a flaming sword, and the bubbling lava and the freezing mist are as one to
    him.
    It is said that at Ragnarok, which is the end of the world, and only then, Surtr
    will leave his station. He will go forth from Muspell with his flaming sword and
    burn the world with fire, and one by one the gods will fall before him.
    II
    Between Muspell and Niflheim was a void, an empty place of nothingness,
    without form. The rivers of the mist world flowed into the void, which was
    called Ginnungagap, the “yawning gap.” Over time beyond measure, these
    poisoned rivers, in the region between fire and mist, slowly solidified into huge
    glaciers. The ice in the north of the void was covered in frozen fog and pellets of
    hail, but to the south, where the glaciers reached the land of fire, the embers and
    the sparks from Muspell met the ice, and warm winds from the flame lands made
    the air above the ice as gentle and as comfortable as a spring day.
    Where the ice and the fire met the ice melted, and in the melting waters life
    appeared: the likeness of a person bigger than worlds, huger than any giant there
    will be or has ever been. This was neither male, nor was it female, but was both
    at the same time.
    This creature was the ancestor of all the giants, and it called itself Ymir.
    Ymir was not the only living thing to be formed by the melting of the ice:
    there was also a hornless cow, more enormous than the mind could hold. She
    licked the salty blocks of ice for food and for drink, and the milk that ran from
    her four udders flowed like rivers. It was this milk that nourished Ymir.
    The giant drank the milk, and grew.
    Ymir called the cow Audhumla.
    The cow’s pink tongue licked people from the blocks of ice: the first day
    only a man’s hair, the second his head, and the third day the shape of a whole
    man was revealed.
    This was Buri, the ancestor of the gods.
    Ymir slept, and while it slept, it gave birth: a male and a female giant were
    born from beneath Ymir’s left arm, a six-headed giant born from its legs. From
    these, Ymir’s children, all giants are descended.
    Buri took a wife from among these giants, and they had a son, whom they
    called Bor. Bor married Bestla, daughter of a giant, and together they had three
    sons: Odin, Vili, and Ve.
    Odin and Vili and Ve, the three sons of Bor, grew into manhood. They saw
    as they grew, far off, the flames of Muspell and the darkness of Niflheim, but
    they knew that each place would be death to them. The brothers were trapped
    forever in Ginnungagap, the vast gap between the fire and the mist. They might
    as well have been nowhere.
    There was no sea and no sand, no grass nor rocks, no soil, no trees, no sky,
    no stars. There was no world, no heaven and no earth, at that time. The gap was
    nowhere: only an empty place waiting to be filled with life and with existence.
    It was time for the creation of everything. Ve and Vili and Odin looked at
    each other and spoke of what was needful to do, there in the void of
    Ginnungagap. They spoke of the universe, and of life, and of the future.
    Odin and Vili and Ve killed the giant Ymir. It had to be done. There was no
    other way to make the worlds. This was the beginning of all things, the death
    that made all life possible.
    They stabbed the great giant. Blood gushed out from Ymir’s corpse in
    unimaginable quantities; fountains of blood as salt as the sea and gray as the
    oceans gushed out in a flood so sudden, so powerful, and so deep that it swept
    away and drowned all the giants. (Only one giant, Bergelmir, Ymir’s grandson,
    and his wife survived, by clambering onto a wooden box, which bore them like a
    boat. All the giants we see and we fear today are descended from them.)
    Odin and his brothers made the soil from Ymir’s flesh. Ymir’s bones they
    piled up into mountains and cliffs.
    Our rocks and pebbles, the sand and gravel you see: these were Ymir’s teeth,
    and the fragments of bones that were broken and crushed by Odin and Vili and
    Ve in their battle with Ymir.
    The seas that girdle the worlds: these were Ymir’s blood and his sweat.
    Look up into the sky: you are looking at the inside of Ymir’s skull. The stars
    you see at night, the planets, all the comets and the shooting stars, these are the
    sparks that flew from the fires of Muspell. And the clouds you see by day? These
    were once Ymir’s brains, and who knows what thoughts they are thinking, even
    now.
    III
    The world is a flat disk, and the sea encircles the perimeter. Giants live at the
    edges of the world, beside the deepest seas.
    To keep the giants at bay, Odin and Vili and Ve made a wall from Ymir’s
    eyelashes and set it around the middle of the world. They called the place within
    the wall Midgard.
    Midgard was empty. The lands were beautiful, but nobody walked the
    meadows or fished in the clear waters, nobody explored the rocky mountains or
    stared up at the clouds.
    Odin and Vili and Ve knew that a world is not a world until it is inhabited.
    They wandered high and low, looking for people, and they found nothing. At
    last, on the rocky shingle at the edge of the sea, they found two logs, sea-tossed,
    that had floated there on the tides and been cast ashore.
    The first log was a log of ash wood. The ash tree is resilient and handsome
    and its roots go deep. Its wood carves well and will not split or crack. Ash wood
    makes a good tool handle, or the shaft of a spear.
    The second log they found, beside the first on the beach, so close to the first
    log they were almost touching, was a log of elm wood. The elm tree is graceful,
    but its wood is hard enough to be made into the toughest planks and beams; you
    can build a fine home or a hall from elm wood.
    The gods took the two logs. They set the logs so they were upright on the
    sand, the height of people. Odin held them, and one by one he breathed life into
    them. No longer were they dead logs on a beach: now they were alive.
    Vili gave them will; he gave them intelligence and drive. Now they could
    move, and they could want.
    Ve carved the logs. He gave them the shape of people. He carved their ears,
    that they might hear, and their eyes, that they might see, and lips, that they might
    speak.
    The two logs stood on the beach, two naked people. Ve had carved one with
    male genitals, the other he had carved female.
    The three brothers made clothes for the woman and the man, to cover
    themselves and to keep them warm, in the chilly sea-spray on the beach at the
    edge of the world.
    Last of all they gave the two people they had made names: the man they
    called Ask, or Ash Tree; the woman they called Embla, or Elm.
    Ask and Embla were the father and the mother of all of us: every human
    being owes its life to its parents and their parents and their parents before them.
    Go far enough back, and the ancestors of each of us were Ask and Embla.
    Embla and Ask stayed in Midgard, safe behind the wall the gods had made
    from Ymir’s eyelashes. In Midgard they would make their homes, protected
    from giants and monsters and all the dangers that wait in the wastes. In Midgard
    they could raise their children in peace.
    That is why Odin is called the all-father. Because he was the father of the
    gods, and because he breathed the breath of life into our grandparents’
    grandparents’ grandparents. Whether we are gods or mortals, Odin is the father
    of us all`,
    `The first thing I ever hacked was bedtime.
    It felt unfair, being forced by my parents to go to sleep—before they went to
    sleep, before my sister went to sleep, when I wasn’t even tired. Life’s first little
    injustice.
    Many of the first 2,000 or so nights of my life ended in civil disobedience:
    crying, begging, bargaining, until—on night 2,193, the night I turned six years
    old—I discovered direct action. The authorities weren’t interested in calls for
    reform, and I wasn’t born yesterday. I had just had one of the best days of my
    young life, complete with friends, a party, and even gifts, and I wasn’t about to
    let it end just because everyone else had to go home. So I went about covertly
    resetting all the clocks in the house by several hours. The microwave’s clock was
    easier than the stove’s to roll back, if only because it was easier to reach.
    When the authorities—in their unlimited ignorance—failed to notice, I was
    mad with power, galloping laps around the living room. I, the master of time,
    would never again be sent to bed. I was free. And so it was that I fell asleep on
    the floor, having finally seen the sunset on June 21, the summer solstice, the
    longest day of the year. When I awoke, the clocks in the house once again
    matched my father’s watch.
    IF ANYBODY BOTHERED to set a watch today, how would they know what to set it
    to? If you’re like most people these days, you’d set it to the time on your
    smartphone. But if you look at your phone, and I mean really look at it,
    burrowing deep through its menus into its settings, you’ll eventually see that the
    phone’s time is “automatically set.” Every so often, your phone quietly—silently
    —asks your service provider’s network, “Hey, do you have the time?” That
    network, in turn, asks a bigger network, which asks an even bigger network, and
    so on through a great succession of towers and wires until the request reaches
    one of the true masters of time, a Network Time Server run by or referenced
    against the atomic clocks kept at places like the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology in the United States, the Federal Institute of Meteorology and
    Climatology in Switzerland, and the National Institute of Information and
    Communications Technology in Japan. That long invisible journey,
    accomplished in a fraction of a second, is why you don’t see a blinking 12:00 on
    your phone’s screen every time you power it up again after its battery runs out.
    I was born in 1983, at the end of the world in which people set the time for
    themselves. That was the year that the US Department of Defense split its
    internal system of interconnected computers in half, creating one network for the
    use of the defense establishment, called MILNET, and another network for the
    public, called the Internet. Before the year was out, new rules defined the
    boundaries of this virtual space, giving rise to the Domain Name System that we
    still use today—the.govs, .mils,.edus, and, of course,.coms—and the country
    codes assigned to the rest of the world:.uk, .de, .fr, .cn, .ru, and so on. Already,
    my country (and so I) had an advantage, an edge. And yet it would be another
    six years before the World Wide Web was invented, and about nine years before
    my family got a computer with a modem that could connect to it.
    Of course, the Internet is not a single entity, although we tend to refer to it as
    if it were. The technical reality is that there are new networks born every day on
    the global cluster of interconnected communications networks that you—and
    about three billion other people, or roughly 42 percent of the world’s population
    —use regularly. Still, I’m going to use the term in its broadest sense, to mean the
    universal network of networks connecting the majority of the world’s computers
    to one another via a set of shared protocols.
    Some of you may worry that you don’t know a protocol from a hole in the
    wall, but all of us have made use of many. Think of protocols as languages for
    machines, the common rules they follow to be understood by one another. If
    you’re around my age, you might remember having to type the “http” at the
    beginning of a website’s address into the address bar of your Web browser. This
    refers to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, the language you use to access the
    World Wide Web, that massive collection of mostly text-based but also audioand video-capable sites like Google and YouTube and Facebook. Every time you
    check your email, you use a language like IMAP (Internet Message Access
    Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), or POP3 (Post Office
    Protocol). File transfers pass through the Internet using FTP (File Transfer
    Protocol). And as for the time-setting procedure on your phone that I mentioned,
    those updates get fetched through NTP (Network Time Protocol).
    All these protocols are known as application protocols, and comprise just one
    family of protocols among the myriad online. For example, in order for the data
    in any of these application protocols to cross the Internet and be delivered to
    your desktop, or laptop, or phone, it first has to be packaged up inside a
    dedicated transport protocol—think of how the regular snail-mail postal service
    prefers you to send your letters and parcels in their standard-size envelopes and
    boxes. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is used to route, among other
    applications, Web pages and email. UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is used to
    route more time-sensitive, real-time applications, such as Internet telephony and
    live broadcasts.
    Any recounting of the multilayered workings of what in my childhood was
    called cyberspace, the Net, the Infobahn, and the Information Superhighway is
    bound to be incomplete, but the takeaway is this: these protocols have given us
    the means to digitize and put online damn near everything in the world that we
    don’t eat, drink, wear, or dwell in. The Internet has become almost as integral to
    our lives as the air through which so many of its communications travel. And, as
    we’ve all been reminded—every time our social media feeds alert us to a post
    that tags us in a compromising light—to digitize something is to record it, in a
    format that will last forever.
    Here’s what strikes me when I think back to my childhood, particularly those
    first nine Internet-less years: I can’t account for everything that happened back
    then, because I have only my memory to rely on. The data just doesn’t exist.
    When I was a child, “the unforgettable experience” was not yet a threateningly
    literal technological description, but a passionate metaphorical prescription of
    significance: my first words, my first steps, my first lost tooth, my first time
    riding a bicycle.
    My generation was the last in American and perhaps even in world history
    for which this is true—the last undigitized generation, whose childhoods aren’t
    up on the cloud but are mostly trapped in analog formats like handwritten diaries
    and Polaroids and VHS cassettes, tangible and imperfect artifacts that degrade
    with age and can be lost irretrievably. My schoolwork was done on paper with
    pencils and erasers, not on networked tablets that logged my keystrokes. My
    growth spurts weren’t tracked by smart-home technologies, but notched with a
    knife into the wood of the door frame of the house in which I grew up.
    WE LIVED IN a grand old redbrick house on a little patch of lawn shaded by
    dogwood trees and strewn in summer with white magnolia flowers that served as
    cover for the plastic army men I used to crawl around with. The house had an
    atypical layout: its main entrance was on the second floor, accessed by a massive
    brick staircase. This floor was the primary living space, with the kitchen, dining
    room, and bedrooms.
    Above this main floor was a dusty, cobwebbed, and forbidden attic given
    over to storage, haunted by what my mother promised me were squirrels, but
    what my father insisted were vampire werewolves that would devour any child
    foolish enough to venture up there. Below the main floor was a more or less
    finished basement—a rarity in North Carolina, especially so close to the coast.
    Basements tend to flood, and ours, certainly, was perennially damp, despite the
    constant workings of the dehumidifier and sump pump.
    At the time my family moved in, the back of the main floor was extended
    and divided up into a laundry room, a bathroom, my bedroom, and a den
    outfitted with a TV and a couch. From my bedroom, I had a view of the den
    through the window set into what had originally been the exterior wall of the
    house. This window, which once looked outside, now looked inside.
    For nearly all the years that my family spent in that house in Elizabeth City,
    this bedroom was mine, and its window was, too. Though the window had a
    curtain, it didn’t provide much, if any, privacy. From as far back as I can
    remember, my favorite activity was to tug the curtain aside and peek through the
    window into the den. Which is to say, from as far back as I can remember, my
    favorite activity was spying.
    I spied on my older sister, Jessica, who was allowed to stay up later than I
    was and watch the cartoons that I was still too young for. I spied on my mother,
    Wendy, who’d sit on the couch to fold the laundry while watching the nightly
    news. But the person I spied on the most was my father, Lon—or, as he was
    called in the Southern style, Lonnie—who’d commandeer the den into the wee
    hours.
    My father was in the Coast Guard, though at the time I didn’t have the
    slightest clue what that meant. I knew that sometimes he wore a uniform and
    sometimes he didn’t. He left home early and came home late, often with new
    gadgets—a Texas Instruments TI-30 scientific calculator, a Casio stopwatch on a
    lanyard, a single speaker for a home stereo system—some of which he’d show
    me, and some of which he’d hide. You can imagine which I was more interested
    in.
    The gadget I was most interested in arrived one night, just after bedtime. I
    was in bed and about to drift off, when I heard my father’s footsteps coming
    down the hall. I stood up on my bed, tugged aside the curtain, and watched. He
    was holding a mysterious box, close in size to a shoe box, and he removed from
    it a beige object that looked like a cinder block, from which long black cables
    snaked like the tentacles of some deep-sea monster out of one of my nightmares.
    Working slowly and methodically—which was partially his disciplined,
    engineer’s way of doing everything, and partially an attempt to stay quiet—my
    father untangled the cables and stretched one across the shag carpet from the
    back of the box to the back of the TV. Then he plugged the other cable into a
    wall outlet behind the couch.
    Suddenly the TV lit up, and with it my father’s face lit up, too. Normally he
    would just spend his evenings sitting on the couch, cracking Sun Drop sodas and
    watching the people on TV run around a field, but this was different. It took me
    only a moment to come to the most amazing realization of my whole entire,
    though admittedly short, life: my father was controlling what was happening on
    TV.
    I had come face-to-face with a Commodore 64—one of the first home
    computer systems on the market.
    I had no idea what a computer was, of course, let alone whether what my
    father was doing on it was playing a game or working. Although he was smiling
    and seemed to be having fun, he was also applying himself to what was
    happening on-screen with the same intensity with which he applied himself to
    every mechanical task around the house. I knew only one thing: whatever he was
    doing, I wanted to do it, too.
    After that, whenever my father came into the den to break out the beige
    brick, I’d stand up on my bed, tug away the curtain, and spy on his adventures.
    One night the screen showed a falling ball and a bar at the bottom; my father had
    to move the bar horizontally to hit the ball, bounce it up, and knock down a wall
    of multicolored bricks (Arkanoid). On another night, he sat before a screen of
    multicolored bricks in different shapes; they were always falling, and as they fell
    he moved and rotated them to assemble them into perfect rows, which
    immediately vanished (Tetris). I was truly confused, however, about what my
    father was doing—recreation or part of his job—when I peeked through the
    window one night and saw him flying.
    My father—who’d always delighted me by pointing out the real helicopters
    from the Coast Guard Air Base when they flew by the house—was piloting his
    own helicopter right here, right in front of me, in our den. He took off from a
    little base, complete with a tiny waving American flag, into a black night sky full
    of twinkling stars, and then immediately crashed to the ground. He gave a little
    cry that masked my own, but just when I thought the fun was over, he was right
    back at the little base again with the tiny flag, taking off one more time.
    The game was called Choplifter! and that exclamation point wasn’t just part
    of its name, it was also part of the experience of playing it. Choplifter! was
    thrilling. Again and again I watched these sorties fly out of our den and over a
    flat desert moon, shooting at, and being shot at by, enemy jets and enemy tanks.
    The helicopter kept landing and lifting off, as my father tried to rescue a flashing
    crowd of people and ferry them to safety. That was my earliest sense of my
    father: he was a hero.
    The cheer that came from the couch the first time that the diminutive
    helicopter touched down intact with a full load of miniature people was just a
    little too loud. My father’s head snapped to the window to check whether he’d
    disturbed me, and he caught me dead in the eyes.
    I leaped into bed, pulled up the blanket, and lay perfectly still as my father’s
    heavy steps approached my room.
    He tapped on the window. “It’s past your bedtime, buddy. Are you still up?”
    I held my breath. Suddenly, he opened the window, reached into my
    bedroom, picked me up—blanket and all—and pulled me through into the den. It
    all happened so quickly, my feet never even touched the carpet.
    Before I knew it, I was sitting on my father’s lap as his copilot. I was too
    young and too excited to realize that the joystick he’d given me wasn’t plugged
    in. All that mattered was that I was flying alongside my father`
