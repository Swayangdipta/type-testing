    `Shiva gazed at the orange sky. The clouds hovering above Mansarovar had just parted to
    reveal the setting sun. The brilliant giver of life was calling it a day once again. Shiva had seen a
    few sunrises in his twenty-one years. But the sunset! He tried never to miss the sunset! On any
    other day, Shiva would have taken in the vista — the sun and the immense lake against the
    magnificent backdrop of the Himalayas stretching as far back as the eye could see. But not
    today.
    He squatted and perched his lithe, muscular body on the narrow ledge extending over the
    lake. The numerous batde-scars on his skin gleamed in the shimmering reflected light of the
    waters. Shiva remembered well his carefree childhood days. He had perfected the art of
    throwing pebbles that bounced off the surface of the lake. He still held the record in his tribe for
    the highest number of bounces: seventeen.
    On a normal day, Shiva would have smiled at the memory from a cheerful past that had
    been overwhelmed by the angst of the present. But today, he turned back towards his village
    without any hint of joy.
    Bhadra was alert, guarding the main entrance. Shiva gestured with his eyes. Bhadra turned
    back to find his two back-up soldiers dozing against the fence. He cursed and kicked them
    hard.
    Shiva turned back towards the lake.
    God bless Bhadra! At least he takes some responsibility.
    Shiva brought the chillum made of yak-bone to his hps and took in a deep drag. Any other
    day, the marijuana would have spread its munificence, dulling his troubled mind and letting him
    find some moments of solace. But not today.
    He looked left, at the edge of the lake where the soldiers of the strange foreign visitor were
    kept under guard. With the lake behind them and twenty of Shiva’s own soldiers guarding them,
    it was impossible for them to mount any surprise attack.
    They let themselves be disarmed so easily. They aren’t like the bloodthirsty idiots in our land
    who are looking for any excuse to fight.
    The foreigner’s words came flooding back to Shiva. ‘Come to our land. It lies beyond the
    great mountains. Others call it Meluha. I call it Heaven. It is the richest and most powerful
    empire in India. Indeed the richest and most powerful in the whole world. Our government has
    an offer for immigrants. You will be given fertile land and resources for farming. Today, your
    tribe, the Gunas, fight for survival in this rough, arid land. Meluha offers you a lifestyle beyond
    your wildest dreams. We ask for nothing in return. Just live in peace, pay your taxes and follow
    the laws of the land.’
    Shiva mused that he would certainly not be a chief in this new land.
    Would I really miss that so much?
    His tribe would have to live by the laws of the foreigners. They would have to work every
    day for a living.
    That’s better than fighting every day just to stay alive!
    Shiva took another puff from his chillum. As the smoke cleared, he turned to stare at the hut
    in the centre of his village, right next to his own, where the foreigner had been stationed. He
    had been told that he could sleep there in comfort. In fact, Shiva wanted to keep him hostage.
    Just in case.
    We fight almost every month with the Pakratis just so that our village can exist next to the
    holy lake. They are getting stronger every year, forming new alliances with new tribes. We can
    beat the Pakratis, but not all the mountain tribes together! By moving to Meluha, we can
    escape this pointless violence and may be live a life of comfort. What could possibly be wrong
    with that? Why shouldn’t we take this deal? It sounds so damn good!
    Shiva took one last drag from the chillum before banging it on the rock, letting the ash slip
    out and rose quickly from his perch. Brushing a few specks of ash from his bare chest, he
    wiped his hands on his tiger skin skirt, rapidly striding to his village. Bhadra and his back-up
    stood to attention as Shiva passed the gate. Shiva frowned and gestured for Bhadra to ease
    up.
    Why does he keep forgetting that he has been my closestfriend since childhood? My
    becoming the chief hasn’t really changed anything. He doesn’t need to behave unnecessarily
    servile in front of others.
    The huts in Shiva’s village were luxurious compared to others in their land. A grown man
    could actually stand upright in them. The shelter could withstand the harsh mountain winds for
    nearly three years before surrendering to the elements. He flung the empty chillum into his hut
    as he strode to the hut where the visitor lay sleeping soundly.`,
    `Shiva and Nandi were walking back to the royal guest house. Shiva had decided he
    wanted to eat lunch alone. Nandi walked a few steps behind, his head bowed in selfrecrimination. ‘My Lord, I am so sorry’
    Shiva turned around to gaze at Nandi.
    ‘You are right, my Lord. We were so lost in our own troubles and the search for the
    Neelkanth that we didn’t realise the unfairness of our actions on immigrants. I misled you my
    Lord. I lied to you.’
    Shiva didn’t say anything. He continued to stare intensely into Nandi’s eyes.
    ‘I am so sorry my Lord. I have failed you. I will accept whatever punishment you give me.’
    Shiva’s lips broke into a very faint smile. He patted Nandi lightly on his shoulders, signalling
    he had forgiven him. But his eyes delivered a clear message. ‘Never lie to me again, my friend.’
    Nandi nodded and whispered, ‘Never, my Lord. I am so sorry’
    ‘Forget it Nandi,’ said Shiva, his smile a little broader now. ‘It’s in the past.’
    They turned and continued walking. Suddenly Shiva shook his head and chuckled slighdy.
    ‘Strange people!’
    ‘What is it, my Lord?’ asked Nandi.
    ‘Nothing really. I was just wondering at some of the interesting things about your society.’
    ‘Interesting, my Lord?’ asked Nandi, feeling a little more confident now that Shiva was
    speaking to him again.
    ‘Well, some people in your country think just the presence of my blue throat can help you
    achieve impossible tasks. Some people actually think that my name has suddenly become so
    holy that they can’t even speak it.’
    Nandi smiled slightly.
    ‘On the other hand,’ continued Shiva, ‘some people clearly think that I am not required. In
    fact, they even think that my touching them is so polluting that I need to get a shudhikaran
    done!’
    ‘Shudhikaran? Why would you need that my Lord?’ asked Nandi, a little concerned.
    Shiva weighed his words carefully. ‘Well, I touched someone. And I was told that I would
    need to undergo a shudhikaran.’
    ‘What? Who did you touch my Lord? Was it a vikarma person?’ asked a troubled Nandi.
    ‘Only the touch of a vikarma person would mean that you would need to get a shudhikaran.’
    Shiva’s face abruptly changed colour. A veil lifted from his eyes. He suddenly understood the
    significance of the events of the previous day. Her hasty withdrawal at being touched. The
    shocked reactions from the Guruji and Krittika.
    ‘Go back to the guest house, Nandi. I will see you there,’ said Shiva, as he turned towards
    the guest house garden.
    ‘My Lord, what happened?’ asked Nandi, trying to keep pace with Shiva. ‘Did you get the
    shudhikaran done or not?’
    ‘Go to the guest house Nandi,’ said Shiva walking rapidly away. ‘I will see you there.’
    Shiva waited for the larger part of an hour. But it was in vain, for Sati did not make an
    appearance. He sat on the bench by himself, cursing the moment when that terrible thought had
    entered his mind.
    How could I have even thought that Sati would find my touch polluting? I am such a bloody
    idiot!
    He replayed moments of that fateful encounter in his mind and analysed every facet of it.
    ‘If something happened to you, I would never be able to forgive myself.’
    What did she mean by saying that? Does she have feelings for me? Or is she just an
    honourable woman who can’t bear to be the cause of someone else’s misfortune? And why
    should she think of herself as inferior? This entire concept of the vikarma is so damned
    ridiculous!
    Realising that she wasn’t going to come, Shiva got up. He kicked the bench hard, getting a
    painful reminder that his once numb toe had got its sensation back. Cursing out loud, he started
    walking back to the guest house. Walking past the stage, he noticed that there was something
    lying on the dance floor. He went closer and bent down to pick it up. It was her bead bracelet.
    He had seen it on her right hand. The string did not seem broken.
    Had she purposely dropped it here?
    He smelt it. It had the fragrance of the holy lake on a sun-kissed evening. He brought it
    delicately to his lips and kissed it gently. Smiling, he dropped the bracelet into the pouch tied
    around his waist. He would come back from Mount Mandar and meet her. He had to meet her.
    He would pursue her to the end of the world if required. He would fight the entire human race to
    have her. His journey in this life was incomplete without her. His heart knew it. His soul knew it.`
